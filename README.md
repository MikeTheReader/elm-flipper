## About

Elm flipper is a simple component for creating a card-flipping behavior.

## Running Examples

Currently, there are two examples, `simple` and `mouseOver`. Either of these can be run by using make under
the example directory. This will build the files necessary to view the `example.html` file in a browser.

1. Run `elm package install` in the example directory
2. Run `make simple` or `make mouseOver` to make the appropriate example.

## NOTE

Very early stages, and I'm learning, so a bunch of what's in here right now is loosly formed. Please send me a
message or start and issue for areas you see a lack of understanding. Thanks.
